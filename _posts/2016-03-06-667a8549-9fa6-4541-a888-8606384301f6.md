Welcome to **\#365project**, a photography project posting a photo every day of the year. A good portion of the photos is taken on the day of posting, but the project also serves as an excuse to cut down on my backlog of processing older photos which I hadn't had the opportunity to go through. 

Tools used: 

* iPhone 6S
* Sony NEX-5R with either a Sony 16-50mm lens or a Tamron 18-200mm one
* Adobe Lightroom
* VSCOcam (iOS) and VSCO Film 00 (Adobe Lightroom)

Enjoy!
